# NeuralStudy
I've worked on this during the pandemic in my 3rd year of highschool. 

I had a great time, even though I didn't fully understand the math.

It's basically a neural network that I used to recognize hand-written digits from the MNIST data-set. 

Looking back with my current knowledge, I've applied supervised learning on my small neural network, with gradient descent error-correction, and I managed to obtain an around 80%-90% accuracy on my evaluation data ( after a long recondsiderations of the way I used the dataset ).
